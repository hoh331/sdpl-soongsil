Welcome to MeaSSUre:I-V, a software designed for the electrical characterization of transistors (FETs and BJTs) and two-terminal devices (resistors, diodes, etc.) using source-meter units (SMUs) with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy control. The latest version of the software is v1.3.

You can download the software in a standalone exe file at https://github.com/hoh331/sdpl-soongsil/raw/main/MeaSSUre_IV/MeaSSUre_IV_v1_3/dist/MeaSSUre_IV_v1_3.exe. Simply run "MeaSSUre_IV_v1_3.exe" to use the software, no installation needed.

Please note that for running SMUs using GPIB-USB-HS, you need the NI-488.2 driver. You can download it from NI website: https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-488-2.html#305442

Currently, MeaSSUre:I-V supports Model 2400 or 6400 SMUs. The software is free for use and the architecture and usage of the software is explained in the article: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2023.101318 Hongseok Oh, Hyunsoo Kim, Hyerin Jo, MeaSSUre:I-V: Open software for transistor characterization using source-meter units, SoftwareX, Volume 21 (2023) 101318
