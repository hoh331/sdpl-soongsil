For any queries, please reach out to our group leader, Professor Hongseok Oh at hoh@ssu.ac.kr

We are happy to present our latest software offering, "MeaSSUre:I-V". This user-friendly GUI-based SMU control software is designed for transistor characterization, and can be accessed at https://github.com/hoh331/sdpl-soongsil/tree/main/MeaSSUre_IV. Additionally, this software is published in SoftwareX (Hongseok Oh, Hyunsoo Kim, Hyerin Jo, MeaSSUre:I-V: Open software for transistor characterization using source-meter units, SoftwareX, Volume 21 (2023): 101318 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2023.101318)
